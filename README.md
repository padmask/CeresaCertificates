## Source code

Explanation of the Magma source code in each directory

### Root directory

bound.mag: functions to compute upper bounds for the order of the Ceresa cycle modulo algebraic equivalence, if it is torsion.
torsion-order.mag: functions to compute upper bounds for the order of the Ceresa cycle modulo algebraic equivalence, if it is torsion.

### census

This directory contains files for carrying out the census of quartic curves defined by equations with coefficients -1, 0, 1 as described in the paper.  See the file readme.txt in that directory for details.
